<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>Creating new D&D characters can be a daunting task for new players. Our tool allows interested wanderers to enter a few sentences about their ideal character, and our AI-powered backend will develop a character for them!</p>
<h1>Tools</h1>
<ul>
  <dl>Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</dl>
  <dl>Backend: Python (FastAPI, PyPDF, Uvicorn)</dl>
  <dl>Agent: Anthropic, Claude Sonnet 4</dl>
  <dl>Deployment: Render</dl>
  <dl>RAG/database: chromadb (sentence transformers)</dl>
</ul>
<h1>Problems</h1>
<ul>
  <dl>Agent Issues: Hard to integrate the response from the agent with the front-end code. Also difficult to parse through the agent response to convert to JSON.</dl>
  <dl>Working with PDF's: Field mapping with the pdf's provided some difficulty.</dl>
  <dl>Merge Conflicts: When three different people are working all on different versions, when we try to push to main we had plenty of merge conflicts.</dl>
  <dl>Aesthetic Front-end: It was difficult finding a theme for a fantasy and medieval themed website, however with some inspiration from older sites, we found a solid color palette.</dl>
</ul>
